Another idea is using something like Zapier to link my commit comments to my blog entries. I tried creating the form, got frustrated, cried, and then just found some pre-made components to use for now. I'll revisit those two options later.

    As for the quiz app project. It's moving ahead. I started on all the links to all the other pages using the React router. After seeing how I am implementing the links, I'm sure there is a way to refactor them. I'm trying to identify potential refactors as they occur. I think that's in keeping with the spirit of Agile. The next big thing with the quiz app is constructing the quiz logic. That might take a while. That, along with bug squashing and bringing up the UX/UI in parallel with the code, is keeping me busy.`,
